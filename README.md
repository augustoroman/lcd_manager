LCD Manager
===========

A simple web server using github.com/augustoroman/serial_lcd to control a 16x2 USB LCD display.  This is more advanced than the trivial example bundled with the serial_lcd package -- this includes(*) features such as scrolling each line independently, macros for display time, and scheduling text and background colors.

(*) features not actually included yet.
